\section{Introduction}
Key points
\begin{itemize}
\item open-source software-defined radio DSP algorithms
\item minimal dependence on external libraries
\item portable to embedded platforms
\item flexible configuration
\item targets cognitive radios and enabling technologies through
      flexible algorithmic development
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item automatic test scripts for validation and accuracy
\item benchmark tool for estimating computational speed on your machine
\end{itemize}


\section{Quick Start Guide}
To build:
\begin{verbatim}
cd /path/to/liquid/
./reconf
./configure
make
sudo make install
\end{verbatim}
You may also want to build and run the optional validation program via
\begin{verbatim}
make check
\end{verbatim}
and the benchmarking tool,
\begin{verbatim}
make bench
\end{verbatim}
